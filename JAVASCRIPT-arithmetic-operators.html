		//A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.The two numbers can be literals
		var x = 100 + 50;

		//or variables
		var x = a + b;

		//ou expressões
		var x = (100 + 50) * a;

		/*The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands. The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.*/
		// 100 (operando)	+ (operador)	50 (operando)

		//The addition operator (+) adds numbers.
		var x = 5;
		var y = 2;
		var z = x + y;
		//O resultado será 7.

		//The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.
		var x = 5;
		var y = 2;
		var z = x - y;
		//O resultado será 3.

		//The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
		var x = 5;
		var y = 2;
		var z = x * y;
		//O resultado será 10.

		//The division operator (/) divides numbers.
		var x = 5;
		var y = 2;
		var z = x / y;
		//O resultado será 2.5

		//The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.
		var x = 5;
		var y = 2;
		var z = x % y;
		//O resultado será 1.
		//In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder. In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division.

		//The increment operator (++) increments numbers.
		var x = 5;
		x++;
		var z = x;
		//O resultado será 6.

		//The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.
		var x = 5;
		x--;
		var z = x;
		//O resultado será 4.

		//The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
		var x = 5;
		var z = x ** 3;
		//O resultado será 125.

		//x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y)
		var x = 5;
		var z = Math.pow(x,3);
		//O resultado será 125.

		//Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
		var x = 100 + 50 * 3;
		//O resultador será: 250.

		/*
		Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150?
		Is the addition or the multiplication done first?
		As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.
		Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).
		And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses.
		*/
		var x = (100 + 50) * 3;
		//O resultado será 450.

		//When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first. When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right.
		var x = 100 + 50 - 3;
		//O resultado será: 147.
