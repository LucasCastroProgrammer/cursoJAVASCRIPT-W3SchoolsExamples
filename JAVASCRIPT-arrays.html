		/*JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.*/

		/*With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name.*/
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;

		/*This statement changes the value of the first element in cars.*/
		//cars[0] = "Opel";

		/*An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
		An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.*/
		/*Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines.*/
		/*Putting a comma after the last element (like "BMW",)  is inconsistent across browsers. IE 8 and earlier will fail.*/

		var cars2 = new Array("Volkswagen","Fiat","Renault");
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = cars2;
		/*The two examples above do exactly the same. There is no need to use new Array().
		For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the first one (the array literal method).*/

		/*You access an array element by referring to the index number. This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars.*/
		document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = cars[0];
		/*Array indexes start with 0. [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.*/

		/*Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
		But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.
		Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John*/
		var person = ["John","Doe",46];
		document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = person[0];

		/*JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.
		Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.
		You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array.*/

		/*The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods.*/

		/*The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).*/
		var fruits = ["Banana","Orange","Apple","Mango"];
		document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = fruits.length;
		/*The length property is always one more than the highest array index.*/

		/*Accessing the First Array Element*/
		document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = fruits[0];
		/*Accessing the Last Array Element*/

			text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";

		/*The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the push() method.*/
		fruits.push("Lemon");
		/*New element can also be added to an array using the length property.
		fruits[fruits.length] = "Lemon";
		fruits[6] = "Lemon" - Nesse caso, os campos 4 e 5 da array ficam com valor undefined.*/

		/*You can also use the Array.forEach() function.*/
		var text2;

		/*Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.
		Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).
		JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.
		In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.  */

		/*In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
		In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.
		Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.*/

		/*JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
		You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
		You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.*/

		/*There is no need to use the JavaScript's built-in array constructor new Array().
		Use [] instead.
		These two different statements both create a new empty array named points.*/

		/*A common question is: How do I know if a variable is an array?
		The problem is that the JavaScript operator typeof returns "object"*/
		document.getElementById("demo10").innerHTML = typeof fruits;
		/*To solve this problem ECMAScript 5 defines a new method Array.isArray(). The problem with this solution is that ECMAScript 5 is not supported in older browsers.*/
		document.getElementById("demo11").innerHTML = Array.isArray(fruits);
		/*To solve this problem you can create your own isArray() function. The function above always returns true if the argument is an array.*/
		function isArray(x){
			return x.constructor.toString().indexOf("Array") > -1;
		}
		/*The instanceof operator returns true if an object is created by a given constructor.*/
