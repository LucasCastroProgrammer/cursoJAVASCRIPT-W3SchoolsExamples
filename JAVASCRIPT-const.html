		//You can add a property:
		car.owner = "Johnson";

		/*But you can NOT reassign a constant object.*/

		/*You can change the elements of a constant array.*/
		//You can create a constant array:
		const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

		cars[0] = "Toyota";

		//You can add an element:
		cars.push("Audi");

		//But you can NOT reassign a constant array.
