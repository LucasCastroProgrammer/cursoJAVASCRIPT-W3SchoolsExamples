		//JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more.

		//In programming, data types is an important concept. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type. Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:
		var x = 16 + "volvo";
		//Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result? JavaScript will treat the example above as:
		var x = "16" + "Volvo";
		//O valor de x será 16Volvo.
		//When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
		var x = "Volvo" + 16;
		//O valor de x será Volvo16.

		//JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results.
		var x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
		//O valor de x será 20Volvo.
		var x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
		//O valor de x será Volvo164.

		//JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.
		var x; //Now is undefined
		x = 5; //now is a number
		x = "John" //Now is a String

		// A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe". Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes
		var carName1 = "Volvo XC60"; //Aspas simples
		var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60'; //Aspas duplas

		//You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.
		var answer = "It's alright"; //Aspa simples dentro de aspas duplas.
		var answer = "He is called 'Johnny'"; //Aspas simples dentro de aspas duplas.
		var answer = 'He is called "Johnny"'; //Aspas duplas dentro de aspas simples.

		//JavaScript has only one type of numbers. Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.
		var x1 = 34.00;
		var x2 = 34;

		//Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation.
		var y = 123e5; //12300000
		var z = 123e-5; //0.00123

		//Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
		//Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
		var x = 5;
		var y = 5;
		var z = 6;
		//(x == y) Returns true
		//(x == z) Returns false

		//JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas. The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names). Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.
		var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

		//JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
		var person = {
			firstName : "John",
			lastName : "Doe",
			age : 50,
			eyeColor : "blue"
		};
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
		//The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor.

		//You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.
		typeof "" //Retorna "string"
		typeof "John" //Retorna "string"
		typeof "John Doe" //Retorna "string"
		typeof 0 //Retorna números
		typeof 314 //Retorna números
		typeof 3.14 //Retorna números
		typeof (3) //Retorna números
		typeof (3 + 4) //Retorna números

		//In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
		var car; //Value is undefined, type is undefined.
		//Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.
		car = undefined; //Value is undefined, type is undefined.

		//An empty value has nothing to do with undefined. An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
		var car = ""; //The value is "", the typeof is "string"

		//In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist. Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
		//You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.
		//You can empty an object by setting it to null.
		person = null; //Now value is null, but type is still an object.
		//You can also empty an object by setting it to undefined. person = undefined.

		//undefined and null are equal in value but different in type.
		typeof undefined //undefined
		typeof null //object
		null === undefined //false
		null == undefined //true

		/*
		A primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and methods.
		The typeof operator can return one of these primitive types:
		string
		number
		boolean
		undefined
		*/
		typeof "John" //Retorna "string"
		typeof 3.14 //Retorna "number"
		typeof true //Retorna "boolean"
		typeof false //Retorna "boolean"
		typeof x //Retorna "undefined" (se o x não tiver valor)

		/*The typeof operator can return one of two complex types:
		function
		object
		The typeof operator returns object for both objects, arrays, and null.
		The typeof operator does not return object for functions.*/
		typeof {name: 'John', age:34} //Returns "object"
		typeof [1,2,3,4] //Returns "object" (not "array", see note below)
		typeof null //Returns "object"
		typeof function myFunc(){} //Returns "function"
		//The typeof operator returns "object" for arrays because in JavaScript arrays are objects.
