		It is common to use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function".
		It is also common to say "call upon a function", "start a function", or "execute a function".
		We will use invoke, because a JavaScript function can be invoked without being called.

		In HTML the default global object is the HTML page itself, so the function above "belongs" to the HTML page.
		In a browser the page object is the browser window. The function above automatically becomes a window function.
		myFunction() and window.myFunction() is the same function.*/

		/*This is a common way to invoke a JavaScript function, but not a very good practice.
		Global variables, methods, or functions can easily create name conflicts and bugs in the global object.*/

		The value of this, when used in a function, is the object that "owns" the function.*/

		Test it! Change the fullName method to return the value of this.*/
		/*Invoking a function as an object method, causes the value of this to be the object itself.*/

		It looks like you create a new function, but since JavaScript functions are objects you actually create a new object*/
