		/*To understand this, you have to understand the term "hoisting".
		Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).*/

		//Variables and constants declared with let or const are not hoisted!

		//JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
		//Example 1 does not give the same result as Example 2.
		var a = 5;
		var b = 7;
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = a + " " + b;

		var c = 5;
		document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = c + " " + d;
		d = 7;

		/*Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.
		If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).
		To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.
		Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.
		JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not declared.
		Study "use strict" in the next chapter.*/
