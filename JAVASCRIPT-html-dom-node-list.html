		/*An HTMLCollection (previous chapter) is a collection of HTML elements.
		A NodeList is a collection of document nodes.
		A NodeList and an HTML collection is very much the same thing.
		Both an HTMLCollection object and a NodeList object is an array-like list (collection) of objects.
		Both have a length property defining the number of items in the list (collection).
		Both provide an index (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) to access each item like an array.
		HTMLCollection items can be accessed by their name, id, or index number.
		NodeList items can only be accessed by their index number.
		Only the NodeList object can contain attribute nodes and text nodes.
		A node list is not an array!
		A node list may look like an array, but it is not.
		You can loop through the node list and refer to its nodes like an array.
		However, you cannot use Array Methods, like valueOf(), push(), pop(), or join() on a node list.*/
