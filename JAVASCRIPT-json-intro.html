		/*JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
		JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
		JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.*/

		/*When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.
		JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.
		We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.
		This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.*/

		/*If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server.*/
		var myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
		var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
		window.location = "demo_json.php?=" + myJSON;

		/*If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript object.*/
		var myJSON = '{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}';
		var myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name;

		/*When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.
		JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.*/
		//Storing data:
		myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
		myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
		localStorage.setItem("testJSON", myJSON);

		//Retrieving data
		text = localStorage.getItem("testJSON");
		obj = JSON.parse(text);
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name;

		/*JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
		JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
		JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
		JSON is language independent *
		*
		JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only.
		Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language.*/

		/*Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.
		JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format, into native JavaScript objects:
		JSON.parse()
		So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other JavaScript object.*/
