		/*The JSON syntax is a subset of the JavaScript syntax.*/

		/*JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:
		Data is in name/value pairs
		Data is separated by commas
		Curly braces hold objects
		Square brackets hold arrays*/

		/*JSON data is written as name/value pairs.
		A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value*/
		"name":"John"
		//JSON names require double quotes. JavaScript names don't.

		/*The JSON format is almost identical to JavaScript objects.
		In JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes.*/
		{ "name":"John" }
		/*In JavaScript, keys can be strings, numbers, or identifier names.*/
		{ name:"John" }

		/*In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:
		a string
		a number
		an object (JSON object)
		an array
		a boolean
		null
		In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:
		a function
		a date
		undefined
		In JSON, string values must be written with double quotes*/
		{ "name":"John" }
		/*In JavaScript, you can write string values with double or single quotes.*/
		{ name:'John' }

		/*Because JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation, very little extra software is needed to work with JSON within JavaScript.
		With JavaScript you can create an object and assign data to it, like this.*/
		var person = { name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York" };
		//You can access a JavaScript object like this.
		//returns John
		person.name;
		//It can also be accessed like this.
		person["name"];
		//Data can be modified like this.
		person.name = "Gilbert";
		//It can also be modified like this.
		person["name"] = "Gilbert";

		/*The same way JavaScript objects can be used as JSON, JavaScript arrays can also be used as JSON.
		The file type for JSON files is ".json"
		The MIME type for JSON text is "application/json"*/
