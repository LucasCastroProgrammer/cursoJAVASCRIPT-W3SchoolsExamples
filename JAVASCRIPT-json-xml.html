		/*Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
		Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
		Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
		Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest*/

		/*JSON doesn't use end tag
		JSON is shorter
		JSON is quicker to read and write
		JSON can use arrays
		The biggest difference is:
		 XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.*/
		 /*XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
		JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.*/

		/*For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML:
		Using XML
		Fetch an XML document
		Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
		Extract values and store in variables
		Using JSON
		Fetch a JSON string
		JSON.Parse the JSON string*/
