		JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
		JSON is language independent *
		JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
		* The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.*/

		/*The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
		Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.*/

		/*
		JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties.
		JSON objects are written inside curly braces.
		JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.
		Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name).
