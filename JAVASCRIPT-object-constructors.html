			this.lastName = last;
			this.age = age;
			this.eyeColor = eye;

		/*The examples from the previous chapters are limited. They only create single objects.
		Sometimes we need a "blueprint" for creating many objects of the same "type".
		The way to create an "object type", is to use an object constructor function.
		In the example above, function Person() is an object constructor function.
		Objects of the same type are created by calling the constructor function with the new keyword*/

		/*In JavaScript, the thing called this is the object that "owns" the code.
		The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.
		In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.
		Note that this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.*/

		/*Adding a new property to an existing object is easy.*/
		myFather.nationality = "Inglês";
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "Meu pai é " + myFather.nationality;
		/*The property will be added to myFather. Not to myMother. (Not to any other person objects).*/

			return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;

		/*You cannot add a new property to an object constructor the same way you add a new property to an existing object.

		/*The changeName() function assigns the value of name to the person's lastName property.*/
		myMother.changeName("Doe");
		document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = "Minha mãe se chama " + myMother.name() + "!";
		//JavaScript knows which person you are talking about by "substituting" this with myMother.

		/*JavaScript has built-in constructors for native objects. The Math() object is not in the list. Math is a global object. The new keyword cannot be used on Math.*/

		var x2 = new String(); //Um novo objeto string

		var x7 = new Function(); //Um novo objeto de função
		var x8 = new Date(); //Um novo objeto de data

		/*As you can see above, JavaScript has object versions of the primitive data types String, Number, and Boolean. But there is no reason to create complex objects. Primitive values are much faster.
		ALSO:
		Use object literals {} instead of new Object().
		Use string literals "" instead of new String().
		Use number literals 12345 instead of new Number().
		Use boolean literals true / false instead of new Boolean().
		Use array literals [] instead of new Array().
		Use pattern literals /()/ instead of new RegExp().
		Use function expressions () {} instead of new Function().*/

		var x7 = function(){}; //novo objeto de função

		/*Normally, strings are created as primitives: var firstName = "John"
		But strings can also be created as objects using the new keyword: var firstName = new String("John")*/

		/*Normally, numbers are created as primitives: var x = 123
		But numbers can also be created as objects using the new keyword: var x = new Number(123)*/
