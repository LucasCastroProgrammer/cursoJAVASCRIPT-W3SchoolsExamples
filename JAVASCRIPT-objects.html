	<!-- In real life, a car is an object. A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop. All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times. -->

	<!-- You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values. -->
	<script>
		/*Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.*/
		/*Criando um objeto.*/
		var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500",color:"white"};
		//Mostrar algum dado de um objeto.
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "O tipo de carro Ã© " + car.type;
		/*The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon). JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.*/

		/*You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal.
		Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines.*/
		var person = {
			firstName: "John",
			lastName: "Doe",
			age: 50,
			eyeColor: "blue",
			/*You can access object properties in two ways.*/
			fullName : function(){
				return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
			}
		};
		/*The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties*/
		/*If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition.*/
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = person.fullName();
		/*Objects can also have methods.
		Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
		Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.*/

		/*In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
		In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
		In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.*/

		/*
		When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object.
		Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
