		/*In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.*/

		/*In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
		Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
		Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
		Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
		Dates are always objects
		Maths are always objects
		Regular expressions are always objects
		Arrays are always objects
		Functions are always objects
		Objects are always objects
		All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.*/

		/*A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.
		A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.
		JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:
		string
		number
		boolean
		null
		undefined
		Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).
		if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x. But you cannot change the value of 3.14.*/

		/*"Hello"	string	"Hello" is always "Hello"
		3.14	number	3.14 is always 3.14
		true	boolean	true is always true
		false	boolean	false is always false
		null	null (object)	null is always null
		undefined	undefined	undefined is always undefined*/

		/*JavaScript variables can contain single values.*/
		var person1 = "John Doe";

		/*Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
		The values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).*/
		/*Using an Object Literal:
		This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object.
		Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.
		An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.
		*/
		var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
		//A JavaScript object is a collection of named values.
		//Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines.

		/*The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.
		firstName	John
		lastName	Doe
		age	50
		eyeColor	blue
		Objects written as name value pairs are similar to:
		Associative arrays in PHP
		Dictionaries in Python
		Hash tables in C
		Hash maps in Java
		Hashes in Ruby and Perl*/

		/*Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
		Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions.
		An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
		firstName	John
		lastName	Doe
		age	50
		eyeColor	blue
		fullName	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
		JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.
		*/

		/*With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.
		There are different ways to create new objects:
		Define and create a single object, using an object literal.
		Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.
		Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
		In ECMAScript 5, an object can also be created with the function Object.create().*/

		/*Using the Javascript Keyword new*/
		var person2 = new Object();
		person2.firstName = "John";
		person2.lastName = "Doe";
		person2.age = 50;
		person2.eyeColor = "blue";
		/* 
		The two examples above do exactly the same. There is no need to use new Object().
		For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the first one (the object literal method).
		*/

		/*Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
		The object x is not a copy of person. It is person. Both x and person are the same object.
		Any changes to x will also change person, because x and person are the same object.*/
		var person3 = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}

		var x = person3;
		x.age = 10;

		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person3.firstName + " is " + person3.age + " years old!";
		//JavaScript variables are not mutable. Only JavaScript objects.
