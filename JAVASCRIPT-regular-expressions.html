		/*A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.*/

		/*A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
		When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
		A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
		Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.*/

		/*In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace().
		The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
		The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.*/

		/*The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match.*/
		var str = "Visit W3Schools!";
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = str.search("W3Schools");

		/*Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string.*/
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = str.search(/w3schools/i);

		/*The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string.*/
		var str2 = "Visit Microsoft!";
		document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = str2.replace("Microsoft","W3Schools");

		/*Use a case insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string*/
		document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = str2.replace(/microsoft/i, "W3Schools");

		/*Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches.
		i	Perform case-insensitive matching	
		g	Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)	
		m	Perform multiline matching

		Brackets are used to find a range of characters
		[abc]	Find any of the characters between the brackets	
		[0-9]	Find any of the digits between the brackets	
		(x|y)	Find any of the alternatives separated with |

		Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning
		\d	Find a digit	
		\s	Find a whitespace character	
		\b	Find a match at the beginning or at the end of a word
		\uxxxx	Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx

		Quantifiers define quantities:
		n+	Matches any string that contains at least one n
		n*	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
		n?	Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

		/*In JavaScript, the RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods.*/
		/*The test() method is a RegExp expression method.
		It searches a string for a pattern, and returns true or false, depending on the result.*/

		document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = patt.test("The best things in life are free!");
		document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = /e/.test("Everything sounds better in a box!");
