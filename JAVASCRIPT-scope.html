		/*In JavaScript there are two types of scope:
		Local scope
		Global scope
		JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
		Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.
		Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.*/

		/*Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
		Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.*/
		//carName não pode ser usado aqui
		function myFunction(){
			var carName = "Volvo";
			//carName pode ser usado aqui
		}
		/*Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
		Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.*/

		/*A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.
		A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. */
		var carName2 = "Fiat";
		//carName2 pode ser usado aqui.
		function myFunction2(){
			//carName2 pode também ser usado aqui.
		}

		/*In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
		Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.*/

		/*If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
		This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function.*/
		function myFunction3(){
			carName3 = "Volvo";
		}

		/*With JavaScript, the global scope is the complete JavaScript environment.
		In HTML, the global scope is the window object. All global variables belong to the window object.*/
		var carName4 = "HB20xp";
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I can display " + window.carName4;

		/*Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to.
		Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions).
		Any function, including the window object, can overwrite your global variables and functions.*/

		/*The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared.
		Local variables are deleted when the function is completed.
		In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab), but remain available to new pages loaded into the same window.*/
