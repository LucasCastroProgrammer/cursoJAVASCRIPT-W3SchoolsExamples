	<h2>Declarações em Javascript</h2>
	<p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>
	<p id="demo"></p>

	<!-- A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
	In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
	A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
	In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser. -->

	<!-- JavaScript statements are composed of:
	Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
	Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.
	The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
	JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code. -->
	<p id="demo2"></p>

	<!-- Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
	Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement -->

	<!-- When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed.
	a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b; -->

	<!-- JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
	var person = "Hege"
	var person="Hege"
	A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / )
	var x = y + z;
	-->

	<script>
		var x, y, z; //Declaração 1: declara 3 variáveis
		x = 5; //Declaração 2: atribui valor 5 ao x
		y = 6; //Declaração 3: atribui valor 6 ao y
		z = x + y; //Declaração 4: atribui o valor de soma de x e y ao z

		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "O valor de z é " + z + ".";

		//This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo2"
		//For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = 
		"Hello Dolly.";
		document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = "How are you?";
		//JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions
