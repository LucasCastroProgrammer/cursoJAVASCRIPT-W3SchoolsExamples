		"use strict";
		/*"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".*/

		/*The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.
		It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
		The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
		With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
		All modern browsers support "use strict" except Internet Explorer 9 and lower*/

		/*You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.
		"use strict" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does not understand it.*/

		/*Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
		Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode)*/
		x = 3.14;
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

		myFunction();

		function myFunction(){
			y = 3.14;
			document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = y;
		}

		/*Declared inside a function, it has local scope (only the code inside the function is in strict mode)*/

		/*The syntax, for declaring strict mode, was designed to be compatible with older versions of JavaScript.
		Compiling a numeric literal (4 + 5;) or a string literal ("John Doe";) in a JavaScript program has no side effects. It simply compiles to a non existing variable and dies.
		So "use strict"; only matters to new compilers that "understand" the meaning of it.*/

		/*Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
		Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
		As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.
		In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties.
		In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.*/

		/*Not Allowed in Strict Mode:
		
		Using a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:
		x = 3.14;
		//Objects are variables too.
		
		Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed:
		x = {p1:10, p2:20};

		Deleting a variable (or object) is not allowed.
		var x = 3.14;
		delete x;

		Deleting a function is not allowed.
		function x(p1,p2){};
		delete x;

		Duplicating a parameter name is not allowed:
		function x(p1,p1){};

		Octal numeric literals are not allowed:
		var x = 010;

		Octal escape characters are not allowed:
		var x = "\010";

		Writing to a read-only property is not allowed:
		var obj = {};
		Object.defineProperty(obj, {value:0, writable:false});
		obj.x = 3.14;

		Deleting an undeletable property is not allowed:
		delete Object.prototype;

		The string "eval" cannot be used as a variable:
		var eval = 3.14;

		The string "arguments" cannot be used as a variable:
		var arguments = 3.14;

		The with statement is not allowed:
		with (Math){x = cos(2)};

		For security reasons, eval() is not allowed to create variables in the scope from which it was called:
		eval ("var x = 2");
		alert (x);
		*/

		//In function calls like f(), the this value was the global object. In strict mode, it is now undefined.

		/*
		Keywords reserved for future JavaScript versions can NOT be used as variable names in strict mode.
		These are:
		implements
		interface
		let
		package
		private
		protected
		public
		static
		yield

		var public = 1500;
		*/

		//The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
