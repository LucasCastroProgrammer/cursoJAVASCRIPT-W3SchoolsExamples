		/*A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.*/
		var x = "John Doe";

		/*You can use single or double quotes.*/
		var carName1 = "Volvo XC60"; //Double quotes
		var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60'; //Single quotes

		/*You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string*/
		var answer1 = "It's alright";
		var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
		var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

		/*The length of a string is found with the built-in length property*/
		var txt = "ASDFGHJKLÃ‡QWERTYUIOPZXCVBNM";
		var sln = txt.length;
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = sln;

		/*Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:*/
		//var x = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
		/*The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".
		The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.
		The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:
		\'	'	Single quote
		\"	"	Double quote
		\\	\	Backslash*/

		/*The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string.*/
		var x = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";

		/*The sequence \'  inserts a single quote in a string.*/
		var x = 'It\'s alright.';

		/*The sequence \\  inserts a backslash in a string.*/
		var x = "The character \\ is callled blackslash.";

		/*
		\b	Backspace
		\f	Form Feed
		\n	New Line
		\r	Carriage Return
		\t	Horizontal Tabulator
		\v	Vertical Tabulator
		*/

		/*For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
		If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator*/
		/*You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash.*/
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \
		 Dolly";
		/*The \ method is not the preferred method. It might not have universal support.
		Some browsers do not allow spaces behind the \ character.*/

		/*A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition.*/
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " + "Dolly!";

		/*You cannot break up a code line with a backslash.*/
		//document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = \ "Hello Dolly!";

		/*Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
		But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new*/
		var x = "John"; //typeof x will returns string
		var y = new String("John"); //typeof y will return object
		/*Don't create strings as objects. It slows down execution speed.
		The new keyword complicates the code. This can produce some unexpected results:*/

		var z = new String("John");

		/*When using the == operator, equal strings are equal.*/
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = (x == y);

		/*When using the === operator, equal strings are not equal, because the === operator expects equality in both type and value.*/
		document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = (x === y);

		/*Or even worse. Objects cannot be compared.*/
		document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = (y == z);
		document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = (y === z);
		//Note the difference between (x==y) and (x===y).
		//Comparing two JavaScript objects will always return false.
