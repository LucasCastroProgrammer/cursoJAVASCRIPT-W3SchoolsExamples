	<title>Javascript: onde usar.</title>
	<!-- In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page. -->
	<script>
		function myFunction(){
			document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "Parágrafo alterado.";
		}
	</script>
	<!-- Scripts can also be placed in external files.
	External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

	JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

	To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag -->
	<script src="myScript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Javascript no body</h2>
	<p id="demo"></p>
	<!-- In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags. -->

	<!-- A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
	For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button. -->

	<!-- You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
	Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both. -->
	<h2>Uma página WEB</h2>
	<p id="demo2">Um parágrafo.</p>
	<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Tente agora!</button>

	<!-- In this example, a JavaScript instruction is placed in the <body> section of an HTML page. -->
	<script>
		document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = "Meu primeiro Javascript!";

	</script>

	<!-- You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.
	The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located. 
	Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

	It separates HTML and code
	It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
	Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
	To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags.
	<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
	<script src="myScript2.js"></script>
	-->

	<!-- External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
	-> This example uses a full URL to link to a script:
	<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js"></script>
	-> This example uses a script located in a specified folder on the current web site.
	<script src="/js/myScript1.js"></script>
	-> This example links to a script located in the same folder as the current page.
	<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
	-->
