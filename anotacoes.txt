-> Palavras-chave em Javascript:
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:
break	Terminates a switch or a loop
continue	Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top
debugger	Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function
do ... while	Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true
for	Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true
function	Declares a function
if ... else	Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition
return	Exits a function
switch	Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases
try ... catch	Implements error handling to a block of statements
var	Declares a variable
JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.

JavaScript stores numbers as 64 bits floating point numbers, but all bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits binary numbers.

Before a bitwise operation is performed, JavaScript converts numbers to 32 bits signed integers.

After the bitwise operation is performed, the result is converted back to 64 bits JavaScript numbers.

The examples above uses 4 bits unsigned binary numbers. Because of this ~ 5 returns 10.

Since JavaScript uses 32 bits signed integers, it will not return 10. It will return -6.

00000000000000000000000000000101 (5)

11111111111111111111111111111010 (~5 = -6)

A signed integer uses the leftmost bit as the minus sign.
When a bitwise AND is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if both bits are 1.
One bit example:
0 & 0	0
0 & 1	0
1 & 0	0
1 & 1	1

4 bits example:
1111 & 0000	0000
1111 & 0001	0001
1111 & 0010	0010
1111 & 0100	0100

When a bitwise OR is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if one of the bits are 1:
One bit example:
0 | 0	0
0 | 1	1
1 | 0	1
1 | 1	1

4 bits example:
1111 | 0000	1111
1111 | 0001	1111
1111 | 0010	1111
1111 | 0100	1111

When a bitwise XOR is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if the bits are different:
One bit example:
0 ^ 0	0
0 ^ 1	1 
1 ^ 0	1
1 ^ 1	0 

4 bits example:
1111 ^ 0000	1111
1111 ^ 0001	1110
1111 ^ 0010	1101
1111 ^ 0100	1011

Binary numbers with only one bit set is easy to understand:
00000000000000000000000000000001	1
00000000000000000000000000000010	2
00000000000000000000000000000100	4
00000000000000000000000000001000	8
00000000000000000000000000010000	16
00000000000000000000000000100000	32
00000000000000000000000001000000	64

Setting a few more bits reveals the binary pattern:
00000000000000000000000000000101	5 (4 + 1)
00000000000000000000000000001101	13 (8 + 4 + 1)
00000000000000000000000000101101	45 (32 + 8 + 4 + 1)

JavaScript binary numbers are stored in two's complement format.

This means that a negative number is the bitwise NOT of the number plus 1:
00000000000000000000000000000101	5
11111111111111111111111111111011	-5
00000000000000000000000000000110	6
11111111111111111111111111111010	-6
00000000000000000000000000101000	40
11111111111111111111111111011000	-40

-> O objeto error:
JavaScript has a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs.

The error object provides two useful properties: name and message.
name	Sets or returns an error name
message	Sets or returns an error message (a string)

Six different values can be returned by the error name property:
EvalError	An error has occurred in the eval() function
RangeError	A number "out of range" has occurred
ReferenceError	An illegal reference has occurred
SyntaxError	A syntax error has occurred
TypeError	A type error has occurred
URIError	An error in encodeURI() has occurred

-> Palavras reservadas em JS.
In JavaScript you cannot use these reserved words as variables, labels, or function names:

abstract	arguments	await*	boolean
break	byte	case	catch
char	class*	const	continue
debugger	default	delete	do
double	else	enum*	eval

super*	switch	synchronized	this
throw	throws	transient	true
try	typeof	var	void
volatile	while	with	yield
Words marked with* are new in ECMAScript 5 and 6.

Array	Date	eval	function
hasOwnProperty	Infinity	isFinite	isNaN
isPrototypeOf	length	Math	NaN
name	Number	Object	prototype
String	toString	undefined	valueOf

JavaScript is often used together with Java. You should avoid using some Java objects and properties as JavaScript identifiers:
getClass	java	JavaArray	javaClass
JavaObject	JavaPackage

JavaScript can be used as the programming language in many applications.
You should also avoid using the name of HTML and Window objects and properties:
alert	all	anchor	anchors
